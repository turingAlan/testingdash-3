          <p>Welcome to SellerSetu!</p>

            SellerSetu collects e-mail addresses and other contact details of people who register at our website and
            send us an e-mail. The information we collect is not shared with or sold to others except under the certain
            circumstances and which your use of the Service is deemed to provide to us a valid consent to disclose the
            following:
          </p>

          <p>
            In order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations
            involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of SellerSetu’s terms of use,
            or as otherwise required by law.
          </p>

          <p>
            We share information about our Members with third parties, such as advertisers or partners, for marketing
            and promotional purposes. However, except as otherwise SellerSetu does not rent, sell, or share personal
            information about you with other companies.
          </p>

          <p>
            SellerSetu uses your information on a cumulative basis to help operate our websites and enhance our websites
            design, improve our content, our services and usability. We may also use the information we collect to
            occasionally notify you about important functionality changes to the website, new Services, and special
            offers. We always use a secure connection when collecting personal financial information from you. However,
            no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your SellerSetu account is password-protected and you are free to create further users and user groups to
            whom you shall assign Usernames and Passwords, so only you and those you designate can access it and view
            the member information relevant to your account. Ultimately, you are responsible for maintaining the secrecy
            of your passwords and any account information.
          </p>

          <p>
            By using any of SellerSetu’s Services, or by dealing with a merchant using SellerSetu’s Services, you are
            agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and, as applicable, the SellerSetu Terms of Service.
          </p>

          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our privacy
            practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. If we make material changes to this
            Privacy Policy, we will give you notice of such changes by posting the revised policy on this Website, and
            where appropriate, by other means. By continuing to use this Website or the Support Service after these
            changes are posted, you agree to the revised policy.

        <div className='space-y-4'>
          <p>
            Privacy matters! If you are a merchant, your customers need to understand how you (and how SellerSetu)
            collects and processes their personal information. Accordingly, if you use the Services, you agree to post
            an up-to-date and accurate privacy policy on your storefront that complies with the laws applicable to your
            business. You also agree to obtain consent from your customers for the use and access to their personal
            information by SellerSetu and other third parties. Additionally, if you are collecting any sensitive
            personal information from your customers (including information relating to medical or health conditions,
            racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership or
            sexuality), you agree to obtain affirmative, express consent from your customers for the use and access of
            sensitive personal information by SellerSetu and other third parties.

            call into support and we need to authenticate your account), we may request that you provide us with
            government-issued identification information.
          </p>

          <p>
            We use some of the personal information you provide us to conduct some level of automated decision-making --

            In general, we keep your personal information throughout your relationship with us. For merchants, this
            means we will keep your information as long as you maintain a store on your platform. For partners, this

            with us. Once you terminate your relationship with us, we generally will continue to store archived copies
            of your personal information for legitimate business purposes and to comply with the law, except when we
            receive a valid erasure request, or, if you are a merchant, you terminate your account and your personal
